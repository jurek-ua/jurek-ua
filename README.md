### **Security-Focused Test Automation Engineer | Aspiring Web Penetration Tester (TypeScript)**

So, what do I do? Well, I'm all about building solid, automated tests – the kind that really stand up. But here's the twist: I'm super passionate about baking security right into every step of the software development process. My big goal? To become a pro web penetration tester, using my testing superpowers to hunt down and fix those tricky web vulnerabilities before anyone else does.

### My Toolbox 🛠️

* **Test Automation:** Think **TypeScript** with tools like **Playwright** and **Cypress**, all hooked up for smooth **CI/CD** workflows.
* **Web Security:** I'm diving deep into **OWASP Top 10** – understanding those common web weaknesses. Plus, I'm getting hands-on with tools like **Burp Suite**, **Nmap**, and practical **web app penetration testing** techniques.
* **Languages:** My go-to is **TypeScript**, but I'm also comfy with **JavaScript** and using **Python** for security scripts.
